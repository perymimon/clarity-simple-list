### Candidate UI assignment for Clarity

##### Guidelines

Welcome, this is a continuance to the first assignment. The goal of this assignment is to evaluate development skills in the UI.

Take your time, there is no hard limit timewise.
It is ok to make assumptions. If the requirement is unclear, make assumptions based on your experience & knowledge. Document your assumptions so we can reference them later.
It is ok not to complete everything, but implement your code with a state of mind that it goes to production.
Be ready to explain live implementation or what is still missing to make it production ready.

##### Business Requirement

As a restaurant owner I need to keep a list of my employees so I can integrate to my enterprise application systems for HR purposes.

##### Acceptance Criteria

- Interface to view employees list with create/update/delete actions.
- Interace should be preferably written in vue.js (react is also possible).
- Interface should run locally and be public cloud ready

##### Out of Scope

- Backend integration (data can managed in local global state)
- Security

##### Post Discussion

- Backend integration
- How the iterface can be deployed and distributed

*If you have a perviously developed project, that you can show us and meets the requirements of this assignment, feel free to send it instead.
