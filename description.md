### Candidate assignment for Clarity

##### Guidelines

Welcome, we are happy to be at a stage where both sides want to collaborate together. The goal of this assignment is to evaluate development skills.

Take your time, there is no hard limit timewise.
It is ok to make assumptions. If the requirement is unclear, make assumptions based on your experience & knowledge. Document your assumptions so we can reference them later.
It is ok not to complete everything, but implement your code with a state of mind that it goes to production.
Be ready to explain live implementation or what is still missing to make it production ready.
